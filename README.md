# Stock-Investment-Portfolio-Management

The scope of this project is limited to the equity investments of the stocks and does not tap into the commodity, F&amp;O, or derivatives sections.
The stock market portfolio management system provides a detailed platform for users to
manage, retrieve, and track their stock investments. The system is equipped with capabilities
such as user management, detailed portfolio tracking information, stock order transactions,
archived order transactions, archived market data, and additional features like stock watchlist
management. The stock investment portfolio management system is a highly consistent system
that allows users to view and get the most recent information on stock prices, trading volume,
ask prices, bid prices, order execution, and other market data. The system must be extremely
available and cannot tolerate downtime, enabling users to execute stock orders and get portfolio
information in real time.
